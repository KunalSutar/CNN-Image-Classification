# Built a deep learning model to read a hand written single digit number. The hand written samples were taken from tensorflow_datasets. The dataset was split into 3 groups of training, validation and testing data. Built a  model of 2 hidden layers of length 50 (initially) and ran the training and validation with a optimization of "Stochastic Gradient Descent". After training tweaked a few hyperparameters in order to improve validation_accuracy but not too much to avoid overfitting w.r.t. validation set. Later tested the model with similar accuracy as that of validation set.
